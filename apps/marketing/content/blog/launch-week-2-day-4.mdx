## Introducing Zapier for Documenso

Day 4 ðŸ¥³ Yesterday we introduced our [public API](https://documen.so/day3) for developers to build on Documenso. If you are not a developer or simple want a quicker integration this is for you: Documenso now support Zapier Integrations! Just connect your Documenso account via a simple login flow with Zapier and you will have access to Zapier's universe of integrations ðŸ’« The integration currently supports:

- Document Created
- Document Sent
- Document Opened
- Document Signed
- Document Completed

Each event comes with extensive meta-data for you to use in Zapier. Missing something? Reach out on [Twitter / X](https://twitter.com/eltimuro) (DM open) or [Discord](https://documen.so/discord). We're always here and would love to hear from you :)

## Pricing

Just like the API, we consider the Zapier integration part of the open Documenso plattform. Zapier is **availible for all Documenso plans**, including free! [Login now](https://documen.so/login) to check it out.
