## Introducing Templates

It's day 2 of Launch Week, everybody ðŸ™Œ After introducing [Teams](https://documenso.com/blog/launch-week-2-day-1) yesterday, today we are looking at making Documenso faster for daily use:
We are launching templates for Documenso! Templates are an easy to reuse documents you send out often with just a few clicks. With templates, you can:

- Save often-uploaded documents for reuse
- Define fields once and just fill them out before sending (if at all)
- Create and share templates with your team

## Pricing

Templates are **included in all Documenso Plans!** That includes our free tier: The limit of 5 documents per month still applies, but you are free to reach it with less friction using templates. Sharing templates with other users is only possible with the teams plan. If you want to share templates with people not in your team, we might have something coming up later this week ðŸ‘€

## What's Next for Templates

While this is all great, we have a lot of great stuff coming up for templates:

- More Field Types
- Custom Field Types Defined by You
- Sharing Templates Externally ðŸ‘€
