## Introducing the public Documenso API

Launch. Week. Day. 3 ðŸŽ‰ Documenso's mission is to create a plattform developers all around the world can build upon. Today we are releasing the first version of our public API and we are pumped. This since this is the first version we focused on the basics. The API is With the new API you can:

- Get Documents (Invidual or all Accessible)
- Upload documents
- Delete Documents
- Trigger Sending Documents for Singing

You can check out the detailed API documentation here: TODO API DOCS URL

## Pricing

We are building Documenso to be and open and extendable plattform, therefor the API is included in all current plans. The API is authenticated via auth tokens every user can create at no extra cost. Existing limits still apply (i.e. numbers of included documents for the free plan). While we don't have all the details yet, we don't intend to price the API usage in itself (rather the accounts using it) since we want you to build on Documenso without being smothered by API costs.

## What's next for the API

You tell us. This is by far the most requested feature, so we would like hear from you. What should we add? How can we integrate even better?
