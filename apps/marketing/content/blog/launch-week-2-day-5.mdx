## Introducing Documenso Profile Links

Last Day of Launch Week #2 aka Day 5 üßê We have share a lot of exiting stuff for Documenso this week. We have connected humans with with documents via teams, we have connected machines with documents via the API and Zapier. For the last the we want to announce a completely new product, connecting humans with humans.

Signing documents has always between humans ans signing something together should be as frictionless as possible. It should also be async, so you don't force your counterpart to jog to their device to send something when you are ready. Today we are introducing the new Documenso Profiles:

   Async > Sync: Add public templates to your Documenso Link and let people sign whenever they are ready.

Documenso Profile work with your existing templates: You can just add them to your public profile to let everyone with your link sign them. With profiles we want to bring back the human aspect into signin.

By making profiles public you can always access what your counterpary offer and make them more visible in the process. Longterm we plan to add more to profiles to help you ensure the person you are dealing with is who they claim to be. Documenso wants to be the trust layer of the internet and we want to start at the very fundamental level: The individual transaction.
