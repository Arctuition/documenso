# Developer Quickstart

> **Note**: This is a quickstart for developers. It assumes that you have both [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your machine.

Want to get up and running quickly? Follow these steps:

1. [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) to your GitHub account.

After forking the repository, clone it to your local device by using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/documenso
```

2. Set up your `.env` file using the recommendations in the `.env.example` file. Alternatively, just run `cp .env.example .env` to get started with our handpicked defaults.

3. Run `npm run dx` in the root directory

   - This will spin up a postgres database and inbucket mailserver in a docker container.

4. Run `npm run dev` in the root directory

5. Want it even faster? Just use

```sh
npm run d
```
