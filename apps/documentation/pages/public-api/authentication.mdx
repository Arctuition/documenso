# API Authentication

Documenso uses API keys for authentication. An API key is a unique token that is generated for each client. The client must provide the key whenever it makes an API call. This way, Documenso can identify the clients making the requests and authorize their access to the API.

## Creating an API Key

To create an API key, you need to navigate to the user settings page. Click on your avatar in the top right corner of the dashboard and select "**[User settings](https://app.documenso.com/settings)**" from the dropdown menu.

Once you're on the user settings page, navigate to the "**[API Tokens](https://app.documenso.com/settings/tokens)**" tab. The "API Token" page lists your existing keys and enables you to create new ones.

To create a new API key, you must:

- Choose a name (e.g. "zapier-key")
  - we recommend using a descriptive name that helps you easily identify the key and its purpose
- Choose an expiration date
  - you can set the key to never expire or choose when to become invalid: 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year

After providing the required information, click the "Create token" button to generate the API key.

Once you've created the token, Documenso will display the key on the screen. Make sure to copy the key and store it securely. You won't be able to see the key again once you refresh/leave the page.
